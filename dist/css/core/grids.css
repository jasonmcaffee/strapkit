*   The inline block grid provides the ability to use display:inline-block, without the negative side effects that occur
*   when applying to a ul, dl, etc. (Typically there is spacing that occurs between lis when displayed side by side)
*   after trying each possibility proposed in the below article, we have found that the YUI Grid System is the best.
*
*   Each direct child element of the grid should have the .inline-block-grid-item class applied.
*
*   All you have to do to control positioning is adjust the widths of the inline-block-grid-cells.
*   The display:block will trigger when items are pushed over more than 100%.
*   e.g. if you have 3 cells in your grid, and you set cell 1 width to 50%, and cell 2's width to 50%, cell 3 will get
*   pushed down to a new row.
*
*   Limits:
*   - rearranging of cells is restricted to stacking on top of each other. (e.g. you can't move cell 5 to be on top of cell 1)
*   - media queries are intentionally left out so you can compose your own using the mq mixin

/*
* Flex box is a powerful grid type which allows you to dynamically rearrange cells in the grid, in any order you choose, using css alone.
* e.g. if you have 3 cells in your grid, you could use a media-query for small devices, and have the order rearranged so
* that cell 3 was stacked on top of cell 1, and cell 1 stacked on cell 2.
*
* Equal column heights - all flexbox elements inherit a default value of box-align: stretch. This means they will all stretch to fill their container.
*
* Limits:
* - ie9 and Opera not supported. may need polyfill if possible. todo: research polyfill...

* The box-orient property defines how boxes align within their parent. The default state is horizontal or, more specifically,

* You can change the box-orient value to vertical to make boxes stack on top of each other.
